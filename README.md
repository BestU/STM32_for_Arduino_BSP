UF0 is all-in-one arduino-compatible prototyping platform powered by ST STM32F051C8T6. It also integrates with Seeed Studio grove 4-pin interface, which can be connected with major grove families, making prototype easier and faster. The TSC capacitive touch controller is the unique character for you to have fun with your finger, and it has 32bit timer and 12bit DAC,I2C, UART interfaces for extension.

Put STM32_for_Arduino_BSP under the directory "hardware" of Arduino IDE, and rename "BestU".
